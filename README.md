# Automatic Topic Modeling & Labeling
Using LLMs to perform **automatic topic modeling and labeling** on a dataset provided by the user. It also allows for **queryable document retrieval**.

**Note:** To use, you must add your OpenAI API key in the placeholder in `pipeline.py`.

This project builds upon my prior research in automatic topic modeling and labeling, utilizing LLM-based summarization. You can find my work here:
